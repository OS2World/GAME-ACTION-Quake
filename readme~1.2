QUICK AND DIRTY FOR THE BRAVE:

  Put xquake and xf86quake in the directory where quake.exe is or get the
  "id1" subdirectory and its data files and put it above that.  First,
  run "runme" to submit your machine configuration.  Then run "xquake"
  or "xf86quake" to play the game.  Enjoy.

THE DETAILS:

  This archive should include the files:

    README.intel_linux
    runme
    xf86quake
    xquake

  The runme program is a shell script which will send a letter to
    Crack dot Com with statistics about your computer so that we may learn
	more about the Linux market.  Please run it once.  We need this data
	to make our next game run well on your machine.  It does not send any
	sensitive information.  It is a shell script, and you may inspect
	and edit it if you feel it violates security.
  To run xquake, any X server should do.
  To run xf86quake, you need XFree86 3.1.2E or later.

  To run either xquake or xf86quake, you need about 16Mb of RAM, a Pentium
  (any speed), an X server running in 8bit mode, a keyboard, and a video
  card on a local or PCI bus.  You need Linux version 1.3.88 or later.
  You need ELF binary support.  The Linux version does not support CDROM
  music.  Mouse is supported in xf86quake.  A net card will let you play
  net games over UDP.  There is no serial support in the Linux version.

  To get sound, you'll need the sound driver with mmapable DMA buffers.
  This was definitely available in 1.3.88 and should be available in
  everything after that.  Quake is one of the first apps to use the
  mmapable DMA buffers, so if it crashes, run quake with the "-nosound"
  option.

  To run xf86quake, you must have a video card that can linearly map
  its address space.  Bug your Linux distribution company if you
  don't have them.  You must also run as root.  xf86quake can run
  faster than xquake and runs full-screen.  xf86quake also allows the
  use of the mouse.  You must also setup your XF86Config file to add
  lower resolution modes, typically 640x480 to 320x200.

THANKS:

  Thanks to #linux for lotsa help w/ Linux admin & guidance!
  Many thanks to Linus Torvalds, Alan Cox, Hannu Savoulieren, and Jon Tombs
    for their cool extensions to Linux to make games fast!
