  === Quake ported to Linux by Dave Taylor at Crack dot Com, Inc. ===

                    QUICK AND DIRTY (FOR THE BRAVE)

  Put xquake and xf86quake in the directory where quake.exe is or get the
  "id1" subdirectory and its data files and put it above that.  First,
  run "runme" to submit your machine configuration.  Then run "xquake"
  or "xf86quake" to play the game.  Enjoy.

                             THE DETAILS

  This archive should include the files: README.intel_linux, runme,
  xf86quake, and xquake.  You must get the data files from
  ftp.cdrom.com:/quake/idstuff/quake/quake101.zip.  You take
  the QSW101.? files therein, cat them into one large file named
  "quakedata.exe", then extract that file with lha.  The quake101.zip
  also has files with much more complete documentation on the game.

  The runme program is a shell script which will send a letter to Crack
  dot Com with statistics about your computer so that we may learn more
  about the Linux market.  Please run it only once.  Do not run it again
  even if you get a new version of the game.  We need this data to make
  our next game run well on your machine.  It sends information from
  your /proc directory telling us about your devices, your CPU, your
  memory, etc.  It is a shell script, and you may inspect and edit it
  if you feel it violates security.

  To run xquake, any X server should do.  To run xf86quake, you need
  XFree86 3.1.2E or later.  To run either xquake or xf86quake, you need
  about 16Mb of RAM, a Pentium or Alpha, an X server running in 8bit
  mode, a keyboard, and a video card on a local or PCI bus.  You need
  Linux version 1.3.88 or later.  You need ELF binary support.  The Linux
  version does not support CDROM music.  Mouse is supported in xf86quake.
  A net card will let you play net games over UDP.  There is no serial
  support in the Linux version.

  To get sound, you'll need the sound driver with mmapable DMA buffers.
  This was definitely available in 1.3.88 and should be available in
  everything after that.  Quake is one of the first apps to use the
  mmapable DMA buffers, so if it crashes, run quake with the "-nosound"
  option.  Alpha Quake needs a sound driver patch for EV5 boards.  It
  should be merged into the kernel sometime after 2.0.10.

  To run xf86quake, you must have a video card that can linearly map its
  address space, and that card must be supported in XFree86 3.1.2E or
  later.  You must also run as root.  xf86quake may run faster than xquake
  and runs full-screen.  xf86quake also allows the use of the mouse.
  You must also setup your XF86Config file to add lower resolution modes,
  typically 640x480 to 320x200.  Bug your Linux distribution company if
  you don't have them.

                          ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

  The following environment variables have been added: QUAKE_SOUND_SPEED,
  QUAKE_SOUND_SAMPLEBITS, and QUAKE_SOUND_CHANNELS.  Their defaults are
  11kHz, 16 bits, and 2 channels.  Other configurations have not been
  thorougly tested, but you may want to tweak these if you are having
	sound trouble.

                                   BUGS

  Alpha/Linux Quake does not have sprites due to an uncaught bug, but they're not
  too sorely missed.  In Alpha/Linux Quake, if you want to restart a game,
  do NOT go to the menu and say "New Game".  Instead, open the console
  with the ` (back-tick) character and type "disconnect ; map start".
  Intel/Linux xf86quake flickers badly on our development machine.  Appears to
  be a synchronization problem with the X server.

                                  THANKS

  Thanks to #linux for lotsa help w/ Linux admin & guidance!  Many thanks
  to Linus Torvalds, Alan Cox, Hannu Savoulieren, and Jon Tombs for
  their cool extensions to Linux to make games fast!

                         A NOTE FROM DAVE TAYLOR

  Crack is out of time.  We are doing full-time development of our next
  game and have plenty on our plates.  We can merge in one or two
  more versions of Quake (if necessary) and release them, but we
  will not be fixing bugs unless they're trivial.

  On the bright side, our next game will be a lot of fun and will
  come out sooner if we're not distracted.  This was written
  on 8/7/96.  Crack should have a new web site up in a couple
  weeks to show what we're up to.

  id Software is focusing on the next technology.  Don't bug 'em
  about the Linux ports!  For the latest information on what they're
  up to, finger johnc@idsoftware.com or check out their web site.
